### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thomas

- 2nd year BSc CompSci student at UoP
- Seeking IT Engineering / Network Operations / Systems Administration Placement for 2024-25
- Technical Director @ [PureFM](https://thisispurefm.com) [(Our GitHub)](https://github.com/thisispurefm)
- Learning Python & Dart *(mainly)* and PHP & JS *(for fun)*
- Likes pretty documents (which have probably been typeset in LaTeX)
- Spends lots of time playing with LaTeX
- Writes scripts to do things which could probably be done by hand quicker (see my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/ThomasBoxall) for these)
