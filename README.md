### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thomas

- Final Year Computer Science @ UoP
- Digital Volunteer & Webmaster @ Woodcraft Folk
- Google Workspace Administrator (including automating jobs which could be done by hand faster: [GroupPermissionReset](https://github.com/ThomasBoxall/google-admin-scripts/tree/main/GroupPermissionReset) // [GetSharingInformation](https://github.com/ThomasBoxall/get-sharing-information) // [GetUsersNotSeen180Days](https://github.com/ThomasBoxall/google-admin-scripts/tree/main/GetUsersNotSeen180Days))
- Mostly interested in Infrastructure & System Administration but tolerates software development
- Admirer of Pretty Documents
- Spends lots of time playing with LaTeX to try and make pretty documents
- Writes scripts to do things which could probably be done by hand quicker (see my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/ThomasBoxall) for these)
